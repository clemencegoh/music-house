# music-house
Home for musicians 

## What is this?
An experimental project to build a linkedin/facebook/scheduler-inspired webapp for musicians to use and get gigs on.

## Motivation
Mostly experimental in order to learn how to:
- Build frontend web with NextJS
  - Optimize SEO with SSR
  - Expand upon existing knowledge of React
  - Build something scalable and easy to refactor to match the changing design patterns 
- Build backend with NestJS
  - Determine performance and reliability of service
  - First look at this technology
- Turn this into a monorepo for both frontend + backend
  - Ensure that building frontend + backend in 1 repo is sustainable
  - Inspired by Facebook/Grab's monorepo style

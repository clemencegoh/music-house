# music-house

Home for musicians

## What is this?

An experimental project to build an online platform for musicians to get gigs, teach, learn, interact, advertise themselves, etc etc.

## Motivation

Mostly experimental in order to learn how to:

- Build frontend web with NextJS
  - Optimize SEO with SSR
  - Expand upon existing knowledge of React
  - Build something scalable and easy to refactor to match the changing design patterns
- Build backend with NestJS
  - Determine performance and reliability of service
  - First look at this technology
- Turn this into a monorepo for both frontend + backend
  - Ensure that building frontend + backend in 1 repo is sustainable
  - Inspired by Facebook/Grab's monorepo style

## Features I would like to have

- Video chat
- Calendar Schedule + ability to schedule appointments
- Bidding / Auction system ?
- Facebook clone :) + inspiration from linkedin I guess

  - Add colleagues
    - Upgrade to friends
    - Upgrade to close friends
    - Walao damn paiseh if need go all the way here
  - Share characteristics to linkedin  
    -> more professional profile with CV
    -> and featured performances
  - Some pages for events
  - Some profiles with posts on their walls / updates
    - ability to set privacy for their posts
  - Ability to like and comment on their walls
  - Ability to see popularity ?
  - Searchability

- Sistic clone
  - Ability to buy tickets from event pages

I'll probably be doing this until I'm dead.
